- testutil.CreateTestWallet()
- testutil.SetupTestChain()
```

### 2. Follow Test Patterns
```go
- Table-driven tests
- Mock interfaces where needed
- Proper error checking
- Clear test descriptions
```

### 3. Security Considerations
```go
- Test access control
- Test input validation
- Test rate limiting
- Test encryption/decryption
```

### 4. Performance Testing
```go
- Benchmark critical operations
- Test concurrent access
- Test resource usage
```
